// 2,4,6,8,10,12 ....... is a AP with common difference = 2

// a = first term , d = common difference, n = total terms 

// nth term = a + (n-1)*d

// Sum of N terms = avg*N = (first term + last term)/2 * N = N/2* ( a + a + (n-1)*d) = N/2*(2a + (n-1)*d)

// 2,4,8,16,32 ...... is a GP with r = 2

// a*r,a*r^2, ..... Nth term = a*(r)^n-1 ... n = total terms

// Sum of N terms = a(1-r^n)/(1-r)
